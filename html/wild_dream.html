Hey guys, I wanted to share with you this strange dream I had 
awhile back.  You may get a kick out of it.
                           HERE IT IS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I was walking through a forest.  I came upon a swamp.  There was a 
sign that read :ENTERING THE GROG:.  Then out of nowhere appeared a 
little purple monster.  He said " You shouldn't be here Sam.  This is 
a WhiteDay.  You will need your sword."
  Then he handed me a feather, and disapeared.  I turned to look 
where he went, when out of the fog came a BlackKnight.  He said, " I 
RULE THE WHITEDAY YOU WILL DIE!!"
  He started approaching.  So I drew my FeatherSword, and swung at 
the BlackKnight.  The sword sang out, "KARASHI!!" and struck the 
BlackKnight down.  As I knelt to make sure he was dead, I heard 
laughter behind me.  I turned to look, and there was the BlackKnight, 
and a hundred BadMonkeys laughing and screaming, "URZOOKED 
URZOOKED!!!"                                                          
----------------------------------------------------------------------
             I woke up then in horror and a pool of sweat!  With a 
strong urge to play some Myth and kill something.  I needed revenge!!


                                  Long Live GRU Sam
