<h3>Gimble Head to Head Edition</h3> by
Haravikk of RMA. This version of Gimble has maps with 2 or
4 starting locations, so that head-to-head play can take place on neighboring
start positions!
<p>
It includes all the following maps: 

<ol>

<li><i>Gimble on the Brain</i> South, North, and East. Each of these maps has
two starting locations. These are the ones used for ladder matches.
<li><i>Gimble on the Head</i> These are maps with 4 starting
locations. Good for when you can't get 6 people into your game but you
don't want one person by themself and another sandwiched between two
melee rushers.
</ol>
