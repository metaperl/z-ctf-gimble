<h2>Rating Information</h2>

    Unless you and your opponent start with the exact same rating, 
    <em>even a 
    draw will result in a point gain and loss.</em>
    Drawing a strong player gives the weaker player points and deducts 
    points from the strong player. It is pointless to repeatedly beat up
    on the lower-rated players, your point gains diminish each time you do
    so. You won't lose points, but you will never be the top-rated player
    by doing so.
    The rating system is the same one that is used to rate chess players.

    for an explanation.

<h3><a name=prov>Provisional Rating</a></h3>

    Your rating is considered provisional until you have played 
    <span id=provisional_days>blah blah</span>
    games. This is done so that your playing strength is not judged until
    you have had an opportunity to play against at least 3 other
    opponents... they don't have to be different opponents.

<h3><a name=inactive>Inactive</a></h3>

    If you have not played a ladder match for 
    <span id=inactive_days>blah blah</span>
    days, you are
    considered inactive.


<h2>Maps</h2>

You must download 
<a href=maps/GimbleHeadtoHead_v1.zip>
Gimble Head to Head

a version of Gimble on the Wabe setup for 2 and 4 person play. It was 
originally written by Haravikk of RMA and was updated by Ba'ok of the 
Order of H'Pak.

<h3>Settings for each map</h3>

<ul>

<li>10 minutes
<li>Unit Trading with 1 minute planning time
<li><em>Normal difficulty</em>

</ul>


<h3><a name=lag>Lag, Game Chat</a></h3>
If you lag after 1 minute into the game, it may <em>not </em> be
replayed under any circumstances.
<P>
In-game chat is <em>not</em> allowed. If you talk during the battle,
the opponent can opt to replay that battle any time after you talk up
to the end of the game. This rule is designed to squash the tactic of
chatting to an opponent as a means of distraction. Note that if the
game ends and you have not called for a rematch, then the battle will
be scored as it normally would.
